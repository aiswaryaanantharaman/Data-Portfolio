This project uses statistical analysis, a/b testing, and visualization to decide whether the new landing page 
of an online news portal (E-news Express) is effective enough to gather new subscribers or not. 
The simulated dataset has certain important metrics such as converted status and time spent on the page 
that will help conclude the effectiveness of the new landing page. 
Additionally, the dependence of conversion on the preferred language will be analyzed in this project.
